Feature: Lock for cross site scripting (xss) using arachni against our site

Scenario: Do a quick check for xss and verify no issues are found on the login page
  Given "arachni" is installed
  And the following profile:
  | name | value |
  | url  | http://192.168.0.109:8008/login |
  When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
  """
  arachni --checks=xss --scope-page-limit=1 <url>
  """
  Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected."
